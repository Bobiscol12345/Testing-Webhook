      "description": "(PRE-ORDER) AJS 37 Viggen is a cold war era plane that was manufactured by SAAB AB in Sweden. The Viggen was a short taleoff and landing (STOL) short-medium range ground attack fighter used by the Swedish Airforce from 1970â€“2007. The Viggen was fitted with reverse thrust and folding tail this was so the Viggen could takeoff and land on short runways like roads and could be stored away fast. Fun Fact the Viggen is the only plane that has achieved a radar lock and intercepted a SR-71 Blackbird.",
